======================

![Title](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/IterationTraceability/master/screenshots/title-screenshot.png)

## Overview

The Iteration Traceability app displays basic information and relationships between the user stories in the iteration and their associated defects, tasks, and test cases.

## How to Use

### Running the App

If you want to start using the app immediately, create an Custom HTML app on your Rally dashboard. Then copy App.html from the deploy folder into the HTML text area. That's it, it should be ready to use. See [this](http://www.rallydev.com/help/use_apps#create) help link if you don't know how to create a dashboard page for Custom HTML apps.

Or you can just click [here](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/IterationTraceability/master/deploy/App.html) to find the file and copy it into the custom HTML app.

### Using the App

You can click on a work item link to go to the detail page of the selected user story, defect, task, or test.

## Customize this App

You're free to customize this app to your liking (see the License section for details). Since this app uses a very old version of Rally's SDK, the app is only presented in its deployed form.

## License

IterationTraceability is released under the MIT license. See the file [LICENSE](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/IterationTraceability/master/LICENSE) for the full text.
